This repository contains a Virtual Mouse project, a computer vision-based solution that allows users to control a cursor without a physical mouse. Using hand gestures or body movements, this system provides an intuitive and touch-free way to interact with devices.

Key Features
Gesture Control: Detect and map hand gestures to mouse actions like click, drag, and scroll.
Touch-Free Interaction: Enables hands-free control, ideal for hygienic or innovative applications.
High Accuracy: Uses advanced computer vision techniques for precise tracking.
Real-Time Processing: Delivers smooth and responsive performance.
Customizable: Easy to add new gestures or refine existing ones.
Technologies Used
OpenCV: For computer vision tasks like hand detection and tracking.
MediaPipe/Deep Learning: For gesture recognition and landmark detection.
Python: For coding the logic and building the application.
Applications
Hands-free computing.
Innovative user interfaces for kiosks or public devices.
Accessibility for individuals with physical limitations.
